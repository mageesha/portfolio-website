**Portfolio Website**  
This is a simple personal portfolio website created using HTML and basic CSS. The website includes two main sections:  

1. **Home Page:** A welcoming introduction with a brief overview about me and my interests. It serves as the central point of the website, providing visitors with key information at a glance.  
2. **Contact Page:** A dedicated page that includes my contact details or a form, making it easy for visitors to get in touch.  

The website is designed with simplicity in mind, focusing on clear navigation and a visually clean layout. Basic CSS is used to style the pages, including typography, spacing, and color schemes, ensuring a polished yet straightforward appearance.  

This project is hosted on GitHub and demonstrates my foundational skills in web development.
